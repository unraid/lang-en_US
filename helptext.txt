**Identification** is the *signature* that uniquely identifies a storage device. The signature
includes the device model number, serial number, linux device id, and the device size.

**Temp.** (temperature) is read directly from the device. You configure which units to use on
the [Display Preferences](Settings/DisplaySettings) page.  We do not read the temperature of spun-down hard
drives since this typically causes them to spin up; instead we display the `*` symbol.  We also
display the `*` symbol for SSD and Flash devices, though sometimes these devices do report a valid
temperature, and sometimes they return the value `0`.

**Size, Used, Free** reports the total device size, used space, and remaining space for files.  These
units are also configured on the [Display Preferences](Settings/DisplaySettings) page.  The
amount of space used will be non-zero even for an empty disk due to file system overhead.

*Note: for a multi-device cache pool, this data is for the entire pool as returned by btrfs.*

**Reads, Writes** are a count of I/O requests sent to the device I/O drivers.  These statistics may
be cleared at any time, refer to the Array Status section below.

**Errors** counts the number of *unrecoverable* errors reported by the device
I/O drivers. Missing data due to unrecoverable array read errors is filled in on-the-fly using parity
reconstruct (and we attempt to write this data back to the sector(s) which failed). Any unrecoverable
write error results in *disabling* the disk.

**FS** indicates the file system detected in partition 1 of the device.

**View** column contains a folder icon indicating the device is *mounted*. Click the icon to
browse the file system.

If "Display array totals" is enable on the [Display Preferences](Settings/DisplaySettings) page, a
**Total** line is included which provides a tally of the device statistics, including the average temperature
of your devices.

The Array must be Stopped in order to change Array device assignments.

An unRAID array consists of one or two Parity disks and a number of Data disks. The Data
disks are exclusively used to store user data, and the Parity disk(s) provides the redundancy necessary
to recover from disk failures.

Since data is not striped across the array, the Parity disk(s) must be as large, or larger than the largest Data
disk.  Parity should also be your highest performance drive.

Each Data disk has its own file system and can be exported as a
separate share.

**Pool Devices** is a single device, or pool of multiple devices, *outside* the unRAID array.  It may be exported for network access just
like an Array device.  Being outside the unRAID array results in significantly faster write access.

There are two ways to configure the Pool devices:

1. As a single device, or
2. As a multi-device pool.

When configured as a single device you may format the device using any supported file system (btrfs, reiserfs,
or xfs).  This configuration offers the highest performance, but at the cost of no data protection - if the
single pool device fails all data contained on it may be lost.

When configured as a multi-device pool, Unraid OS will automatically select *btrfs-raid1* format (for both data
and meta-data).  btrfs permits any number of devices to be added to the pool and each copy of data is guaranteed
to be written to two different devices.  Hence the pool can withstand a single-disk failure without losing data.

When [User Shares](/Settings/ShareSettings) are enabled, user shares may be configured to
automatically make use of the Pool device in order to
speed up writes.  A special background process called the *mover* can be scheduled to run
periodically to move user share files off the Cache and onto the Array.

#### Assigning Devices

An unRAID disk array consists of a number of Data disks and up to two Parity disks. The data
disks are exclusively used to store user data, and the Parity disk(s) provides the redundancy necessary
to recover from any single or double disk failure.

Note that we are careful to use the term *disk* when referring to an array storage device.  We
use the term *hard drive* (or sometimes just *drive*) when referring to an actual hard disk drive (HDD)
device. This is because in a RAID system it is possible to read/write an array disk whose corresponding
hard drive is disabled or even missing! In addition, it is useful to be able to ask, "which device is
assigned to be the Parity disk?"; or, "which device corresponds to disk2?".

We therefore need a way to assign hard drives to array disks. This is accomplished here on the
Main page when the array is stopped. There is a drop-down box for each array disk which lists all the
unassigned devices. To assign a device simply select it from the list. Each time a device
assignment is made, the system updates a configuration file to record the assignment.

#### Requirements

Unlike traditional RAID systems which stripe data across all the array devices, an Unraid server
stores files on individual hard drives. Consequently, all file write operations will involve both the
Data disk the file is being written to, and the Parity disk(s).  For these reasons,

* a Parity disk size must be as large or larger than any of the Data disks,

and

* given a choice, Parity disk(s) should be the fastest disk(s) in your collection.

#### Guidelines

Here are the steps you should follow when designing your unRAID disk array:

1. Decide which hard drive you will use for parity, and which hard drives you will use for
Data disk1, disk2, etc., and label them in some fashion. Also, find the serial number of each hard
drive and jot it down somewhere; you will need this information later.

2. Install your hard drive devices, boot your server and bring up the webGUI. If this is a fresh system
build, then the Main page will show no disks installed. This doesn't mean the system can't detect your
hard drives; it just means that none have been assigned yet.

3. Remember the serial numbers you recorded back in step 1? For parity and each Data disk, select the
proper hard drive based on its serial number from the drop down list.

#### Hot Plug

You may also *hot plug* hard drives into your server if your hardware supports it. For example,
if you are using hard drive cages, you may simply plug them into your server while powered on and
with array Stopped. Refresh the Main page to have new unassigned devices appear in the assignment
dropdown lists.

#### Next Steps

Once you have assigned all of your hard drives, refer to the Array Status section below
and Start the array.
:end

:encryption_help:
#### Encryption input

With array Stopped, the user can specify a new encryption key. Note that once a device
is formatted with a particular key it may only be opened using that same key. Changing the encryption key requires
encrypted devices to be reformatted **resulting in permanent loss of all existing data on those devices.**

#### Passphrase

Enter a passphrase of up to 512 characters. It is highly advisable to only use the 95 printable characters from the
first 128 characters of the [ASCII table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII), as they will always have the same binary
representation. Other characters may have different encoding depending on system configuration and your passphrase will
not work with a different encoding. If you want a longer passphrase or to include binary data, upload a keyfile instead.

Please refer to the [cryptsetup FAQ](https://gitlab.com/cryptsetup/cryptsetup/wikis/FrequentlyAskedQuestions#5-security-aspects)
for what constitutes a *secure* passphrase.

**Memorize** this passphrase. **IF LOST, ENCRYPTED CONTENT CANNOT BE RECOVERED!**

#### Keyfile

Select a local keyfile with a stored encryption key or a binary file. The maximum size of the keyfile is 8M (8388608 byte).

**Backup** your local keyfile. **IF LOST, ENCRYPTED CONTENT CANNOT BE RECOVERED!**

:info_btrfs_balance_help:
**Balance** will run the *btrfs balance* program to restripe the extents across all pool devices, for example,
to convert the pool from raid1 to raid0 or vice-versa.

When a *full balance* is performed, it basically rewrites everything in the current filesystem.

A *mode conversion* affects the btrfs data extents; metadata always uses raid1 and is converted to raid1 if necessary by any balance operation.

The run time is potentially very long, depending on the filesystem size and speed of the device.

Unraid OS uses these default options when creating a multiple-device pool:

`-dconvert=raid1 -mconvert=raid1`

For more complete documentation, please refer to the btrfs-balance [Manpage](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/btrfs-balance.8.html)

*high water mark* is initialized with the size of the largest Data disk divided by 2.  If no disk
has free space above the current *high water mark*, divide the *high water mark* by 2 and choose again.

The goal of **High-water** is to write as much data as possible to each disk (in order to minimize
how often disks need to be spun up), while at the same time, try to keep the same amount of free space on
each disk (in order to distribute data evenly across the array).

**Fill-up**

:share_edit_split_level_help:
Determines whether a directory is allowed to expand onto multiple disks.

**Automatically split any directory as required**
When a new file or subdirectory needs to be created in a share, Unraid OS first chooses which disk
it should be created on, according to the configured *Allocation method*.  If the parent directory containing
the new file or subdirectory does not exist on this disk, then Unraid OS will first create all necessary
parent directories, and then create the new file or subdirectory.

**Automatically split only the top level directory as required**
When a new file or subdirectory is being created in the first level subdirectory of a share, if that first
level subdirectory does not exist on the disk being written, then the subdirectory will be created first.
If a new file or subdirectory is being created in the second or lower level subdirectory of a share, the new
file or subdirectory is created on the same disk as the new file or subdirectory's parent directory.

**Automatically split only the top "N" level directories as required**
Similar to previous: when a new file or subdirectory is being created, if the parent directory is at level "N",
and does not exist on the chosen disk, Unraid OS will first create all necessary parent directories.  If the
parent directory of the new file or subdirectory is beyond level "N", then the new file or subdirectory is
created on the same disk where the parent directory exists.

**Manual: do not automatically split directories**
When a new file or subdirectory needs to be created in a share, Unraid OS will only consider disks where the
parent directory already exists.

*Mover* will take no action so any existing files for this share that are on the cache are left there.

**Yes** indicates that all new files and subdirectories should be written to the Cache disk/pool, provided
enough free space exists on the Cache disk/pool.
If there is insufficient space on the Cache disk/pool, then new files and directories are created on the array.
When the *mover* is invoked, files and subdirectories are transferred off the Cache disk/pool and onto the array.

**Only** indicates that all new files and subdirectories must be written to the Cache disk/pool.
If there is insufficient free space on the Cache disk/pool, *create* operations will fail with *out of space* status.
*Mover* will take no action so any existing files for this share that are on the array are left there.

**Prefer** indicates that all new files and subdirectories should be written to the Cache disk/pool, provided
enough free space exists on the Cache disk/pool.
If there is insufficient space on the Cache disk/pool, then new files and directories are created on the array.
When the *mover* is invoked, files and subdirectories are transferred off the array and onto the Cache disk/pool.

:smb_time_machine_volume_help:
This limits the reported volume size, preventing Time Machine from using the entire real disk space

:smb_case_sensitive_names_help:
Controls whether filenames are case-sensitive.

The default setting of **auto** allows clients that support case sensitive filenames (Linux CIFSVFS)
to tell the Samba server on a per-packet basis that they wish to access the file system in a case-sensitive manner (to support UNIX
case sensitive semantics). No Windows system supports case-sensitive filenames so setting this option to **auto** is the same as
setting it to No for them; however, the case of filenames passed by a Windows client will be preserved.  This setting can result
in reduced performance with very large directories because Samba must do a filename search and match on passed names.

A setting of **Yes** means that files are created with the case that the client passes, and only accessible using this same case.
This will speed very large directory access, but some Windows applications may not function properly with this setting.  For
example, if "MyFile" is created but a Windows app attempts to open "MYFILE" (which is permitted in Windows), it will not be found.

A value of **Forced lower** is special: the case of all incoming client filenames, not just new filenames, will be set to lower-case.
In other words, no matter what mixed case name is created on the Windows side, it will be stored and accessed in all lower-case.  This
ensures all Windows apps will properly find any file regardless of case, but case will not be preserved in folder listings.
Note this setting should only be configured for new shares.

:smb_security_modes_help:
Summary of security modes:

**Public** All users including guests have full read/write access.

**Secure** All users including guests have read access, you select which of your users have write access.

**Private** No guest access at all, you select which of your users have read/write, read-only access or no access.

Windows Server Signing:

If you are unable to browse SMB shares with Windows 11 version 24H2 or newer, you need to make some changes to accomodate a new feature called Server Signing.  Server Signing is enabled in Unraid and you need to make changes to access Public shares.
You can <u><a href='https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/storage-at-microsoft/accessing-a-third-party-nas-with-smb-in-windows-11-24h2-may-fail/ba-p/4154300' target='_blank'>disable it in Windows</a></u>, or to work with Unraid with Server Signing enabled, the easiest way is to create a user (with a password set) in Unraid with the same name as the Windows account you are using, Windows should then ask you for the credentials.
If you are using a Microsoft account, it may be better to just create a user in Unraid with a simple username and set a password, then in Windows go to Control Panel -> Credential Manager -> Windows credentials -> Add a Windows Credential and add the correct Unraid server name and credentials.

When ***Apply*** is pressed a scan is performed to find the changes, subsequently containers which have changes are modified in parallel.

*Important: Please wait until all updates are finished before leaving this page*.

By default NO cores are selected for a Docker container, which means it uses all available cores.<br>
Do not select **ALL** cores for containers, just select **NO** cores if you want unrestricted core use.

Do not select cores for containers which are *isolated*.
By design a container will only use a single core (the lowest numbered core) when multiple isolated cores are selected.<br>
Usually this is not what a user wants when selecting multiple cores.

:cpu_isolation_help:
CPU isolation allows the user to specify CPU cores that are to be explicitly reserved for assignment (to VMs or Docker containers).

This is incredibly important for gaming VMs to run smoothly because even if you manually pin your Docker containers to not overlap with your gaming VM,
the host OS can still utilize those same cores as the guest VM needs for things like returning responses for the webGUI, running a parity check, btrfs operations, etc.

Determines how the webGUI responds to HTTP and/or HTTPS protocol on your LAN.

Select **No** to use HTTP. To access your server use this URL:

`http://<server-name>.<localTLD>`

or this URL:

`http://<server-ip-address>`

Select **Yes** to enable use of an automatically-generated self-signed
SSL certificate.  Use this URL to access your server:

`https://<server-name>.<localTLD>`

Note that use of a self-signed SSL certificate will generate a browser
warning.

Select **Strict** to enable *exclusive* use of a myunraid.net SSL
certificate for https access (see **Provision** below).  Note that a DNS
server must be reachable.

**Redirects:** When accessing `http://<server-ip-address>` or `http://<server-name>.<localTLD>`, the 
behavior will change depending on the value of the Use SSL/TLS setting:

* If Use SSL/TLS is set to **Strict**, you will be redirected to `https://<lan-ip>.<hash>.myunraid.net`
* If Use SSL/TLS is set to **Yes**, you will be redirected to `https://<server-ip-address> or https://<server-name>.<localTLD>`
* If Use SSL/TLS is set to **No**, then the http url will load directly.

Important: **Strict** may not be selectable if your router or upstream DNS server has
[DNS rebinding protection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_rebinding) enabled. DNS rebinding
protection prevents DNS from resolving a private IP network range. DNS rebinding protection is meant as
a security feature on a LAN that may include legacy devices with buggy/insecure "web" interfaces.

One source of DNS rebinding protection could be your ISP DNS server. In this case the problem may be solved by
switching to a different DNS server such as OpenDNS where DNS rebinding proection can be turned off.

More commonly, DNS rebinding protection could be enabled in your router. Most consumer routers do not implement DNS
rebinding protection; but, if they do, a configuration setting should be available to turn it off.

Higher end routers usually do enable DNS rebinding protection. Typically there are ways of turning it off
entirely or selectively based on domain. Examples:

**DD-WRT:** If you are using "dnsmasq" with DNS rebinding protection enabled, you can add this line to your router
configuration file:

`rebind-domain-ok=/myunraid.net/`

**pfSense:** If you are using pfSense internal DNS resolver service, you can add these Custom Option lines:

`server:`<br>
`private-domain: "myunraid.net"`

**Ubiquiti USG router:** you can add this configuration line:

`set service dns forwarding options rebind-domain-ok=/myunraid.net/`

**OpenDNS:** Go to Settings -> Security and *remove* the checkbox next to
 "Suspicious Responses - Block internal IP addresses". It is an all-or-nothing setting.

When all else fails, you may be able create an entry in your PC's *hosts* file to override external DNS and
directly resolve your servers myunraid.net FQDN to its local IP address.

:mgmt_certificate_expiration_help:
**Provision** may be used to install a *free* myunraid.net SSL Certificate from
[Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/).

The myunraid.net SSL certificate can be used in two ways.  First,
having the certificate present enables your server to respond to an
alternate URL of the form:

`https://<lan-ip>.<hash>.myunraid.net`

The `<hash>` value is a 40-character hex string (160 bits) unique to
your server.  A Lime Technology DDNS server will return your `<lan-ip>`
in response to a DNS request on this URL. The certificate Subject is
set to `*.<hash>.myunraid.net` thus validating the https connection.

You may enable this URL exclusively on your LAN by setting **Use
SSL/TLS** to **Strict**.

The second use for a myunraid.net certificate is to enable secure
remote access available through the Unraid Connect plugin feature.  Note
that it is possible to use secure remote access in conjunction with
insecure local access.

After a myunraid.net SSL Certificate has been installed, a
background service is activated:

- *renewcert* - This starts 60 seconds after server reboot has completed and contacts the Lime Technology
certificate renewal service to determine if your myunraid.net SSL certificate needs to be renewed.
Thereafter it wakes up every 24 hours. If within 30 days of expiration, a new certificate is automatically
provisioned and downloaded to your server.

**Delete** may be used to delete the myunraid.net certificate file.

**nginx certificate handling details**

nginx makes use of two certificate files stored on the USB flash boot device:<br>

- a self-signed certificate: `config/ssl/certs/<server-name>_unraid_bundle.pem`

- a myunraid.net certificate: `config/ssl/certs/certificate_bundle.pem`

The self-signed SSL certificate file is automatically created when nginx
starts; and re-created if the server hostname or local TLD is changed.

**nginx stapling support**

OCSP Stapling is automatically enabled if the certificate contains an OCSP responder URL.

Hence, for self-signed certificates stapling is not enabled; for CA-signed certificates
stabling is enabled.

:nfs_enable_help:
Select 'Yes' to enable the NFS protocol.
:end

:nfs_tunable_fuse_remember_help:
When NFS is enabled, this Tunable may be used to alleviate or solve instances of "NFS Stale File Handles"
you might encounter with your NFS client.

In essence, (fuse_remember) tells an internal subsystem (named "fuse") how long to "remember" or "cache"
file and directory information associated with user shares.  When an NFS client attempts to access a file
(or directory) on the server, and that file (or directory) name is not cached, then you could encounter
"stale file handle".

The numeric value of this tunable is the number of seconds to cache file/directory name entries,
where the default value of 330 indicates 5 1/2 minutes.  There are two special values you may also set
this to:

* 0 which means, do not cache file/directory names at all, and
* -1 which means cache file/directory names forever (or until array is stopped)

A value of 0 would be appropriate if you are enabling NFS but only plan to use it for disk shares,
not user shares.

A value of -1 would be appropriate if no other timeout seems to solve the "stale file handle" on
your client.  Be aware that setting a value of -1 will cause the memory footprint to grow by approximately
108 bytes per file/directory name cached.  Depending how much RAM is installed in your server and how many
files/directories you access via NFS this may or may not lead to out-of-memory conditions.
:end

:nfs_server_max_protocol_help:

:end

:eth_enable_bonding_help:
Bonding is a feature that combines multiple physical Ethernet interfaces into a single *bonded* interface named **bond0**.
This can be used to improve the connection redundancy and/or throughput of the system.
Different bonding modes are supported (see below), but some modes require proper switch support.
:end

:eth_bonding_mode_help:
**Mode 0 (balance-rr)**<br>
This mode transmits packets in a sequential order from the first available slave through the last.
If two real interfaces are slaves in the bond and two packets arrive destined out of the bonded interface the first will be transmitted on the first slave and the second frame will be transmitted on the second slave.
The third packet will be sent on the first and so on. This provides load balancing and fault tolerance.

**Mode 1 (active-backup) - default**<br>
This mode places one of the interfaces into a backup state and will only make it active if the link is lost by the active interface.
Only one slave in the bond is active at an instance of time. A different slave becomes active only when the active slave fails.
This mode provides fault tolerance.

**Mode 2 (balance-xor)**<br>
This mode transmits packets based on an XOR formula. Source MAC address is XOR'd with destination MAC address modula slave count.
This selects the same slave for each destination MAC address and provides load balancing and fault tolerance.

**Mode 3 (broadcast)**<br>
This mode transmits everything on all slave interfaces. This mode is least used (only for specific purpose) and provides only fault tolerance.

**Mode 4 (802.3ad)**<br>
This mode is known as *Dynamic Link Aggregation*. It creates aggregation groups that share the same speed and duplex settings.
It requires a switch that supports IEEE 802.3ad dynamic link.
Slave selection for outgoing traffic is done according to the transmit hash policy, which may be changed from the default simple XOR policy via the xmit_hash_policy option.
Note that not all transmit policies may be 802.3ad compliant, particularly in regards to the packet mis-ordering requirements of section 43.2.4 of the 802.3ad standard.
Different peer implementations will have varying tolerances for noncompliance.

**Mode 5 (balance-tlb)**<br>
This mode is called *Adaptive transmit load balancing*. The outgoing traffic is distributed according to the current load and queue on each slave interface.
Incoming traffic is received by the current slave.

**Mode 6 (balance-alb)**<br>
This mode is called *Adaptive load balancing*. This includes balance-tlb + receive load balancing (rlb) for IPV4 traffic.
The receive load balancing is achieved by ARP negotiation.
The bonding driver intercepts the ARP Replies sent by the server on their way out and overwrites the src hw address with the unique hw address of one of the slaves in the bond
such that different clients use different hw addresses for the server.

*Mode 1 (active-backup) is the recommended setting. Other modes allow you to set up a specific environment, but may require proper switch support.
Choosing a unsupported mode can result in a disrupted communication.*

+ **snmp** - hostname:port:vendor:community. Hostname is the ip address or hostname of the UPS on the network. Vendor can be can be "APC" or "APC_NOTRAP". "APC_NOTRAP" will disable SNMP trap catching; you usually want "APC". Port is usually 161. Community is usually "private"
+ **dumb** - /dev/tty**
+ **pcnet** - ipaddr:username:passphrase:port. ipaddr is the IP address of the UPS management card. username and passphrase are the credentials for which the card has been configured. port is the port number on which to listen for messages from the UPS, normally 3052. If this parameter is empty or missing, the default of 3052 will be used
+ **modbus** - /dev/tty**

:apc_ups_override_ups_capacity_help:
If your device doesn't natively report Nominal Power (`NOMPOWER`) from `apcupsd`, but does report the Load Percentage (`LOADPCT`), you can manually define the UPS capacity rating in Watts (W) (this is the 'real power' value in Watts (W), not the 'apparent power' in Volt Amps (VA), and should be detailed on your UPS manual or product listing) and the plugin will dynamically calculate a virtual Nominal Power estimate (`≈`) by comparing the Override UPS Capacity (W) and the current Load Percentage. It is only an estimate, as it doesn't factor in things like the UPS' efficiency.
:end

:apc_battery_level_help:
If during a power failure, the remaining battery percentage (as reported by the UPS) is below or equal to *Battery level*, apcupsd will initiate a system shutdown.
:end

:apc_runtime_left_help:
If during a power failure, the remaining runtime in minutes (as calculated internally by the UPS) is below or equal to this field, apcupsd, will initiate a system shutdown.
:end

:apc_battery_time_help:
If during a power failure, the UPS has run on batteries for *time-out* many seconds or longer; apcupsd will initiate a system shutdown. A value of zero disables this timer.

If you have a Smart UPS, you will most likely want to disable this timer by setting it to zero.
That way, your UPS will continue on batteries until either the % charge remaining drops to or below *Battery level* or the remaining battery runtime drops to or below *minutes*.

Of course - when testing - setting this to 60 causes a quick system shutdown if you pull the power plug.
If you have an older dumb UPS, you will want to set this to less than the time you know you can run on batteries.
:end

:apc_note_help:
**Note:** *Battery level*, *Runtime left*, and *Time on battery* work in conjunction, so the first that occurs will cause the initiation of a shutdown.

:docker_client_general_help:
Templates are a quicker way to setting up Docker Containers on your Unraid server.  There are two types of templates:

**Default templates**<br>
When valid repositories are added to your Docker Repositories page, they will appear in a section on this drop down for you to choose (master categorized by author, then by application template).
After selecting a default template, the page will populate with new information about the application in the Description field, and will typically provide instructions for how to setup the container.
Select a default template when it is the first time you are configuring this application.

**User-defined templates**<br>
Once you've added an application to your system through a Default template,
the settings you specified are saved to your USB flash device to make it easy to rebuild your applications in the event an upgrade were to fail or if another issue occurred.
To rebuild, simply select the previously loaded application from the User-defined list and all the settings for the container will appear populated from your previous setup.
Clicking create will redownload the necessary files for the application and should restore you to a working state.
To delete a User-defined template, select it from the list above and click the red X to the right of it.

:end

:docker_tailscale_serve_mode_help:
Enabling <b>Serve</b> will automatically reverse proxy the primary web service from this container and make it available on your Tailnet using https with a valid certificate! 

Note that when accessing the <b>Tailscale WebUI</b> url, no additional authentication layer is added beyond restricting it to your Tailnet - the container is still responsible for managing usernames/passwords that are allowed to access it. Depending on your configuration, direct access to the container may still be possible as well.

For more details, see the <a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1312/serve" target="_blank">Tailscale Serve</a> documentation.

If the documentation recommends additional settings for a more complex use case, enable "Tailscale Show Advanced Settings". Support for these advanced settings is not available beyond confirming the commands are passed to Tailscale correctly.

<b>Funnel</b> is similar to <b>Serve</b>, except that the web service is made available on the open Internet. Use with care as the service will likely be attacked. As with <b>Serve</b>, the container itself is responsible for handling any authentication.

We recommend reading the <a href="https://tailscale.com/kb/1223/funnel" target="_blank">Tailscale Funnel</a> documentation before enabling this feature.

<b>Note:</b>&nbsp;Enabling <b>Serve</b> or <b>Funnel</b> publishes the Tailscale hostname to a public ledger.

:docker_tailscale_serve_port_help:
This field should specify the port for the primary web service this container offers. Note: it should specify the port in the container, not a port that was remapped on the host.

The system attempted to determine the correct port automatically. If it used the wrong value then there is likely an issue with the "Web UI" field for this container, visible by switching from "Basic View" to "Advanced View" in the upper right corner of this page. 

In most cases this port is all you will need to specify in order to Serve the website in this container, although additional options are available below for more complex containers.

This value is passed to the `<serve_port>` portion of this command which starts serve or funnel:<br>

WireGuard tunnels need an internal IP address. Assign a network pool using the default IPv4 network, 
the default IPv6 network, or assign your own network pool from which automatic assignment can be done for both this server and any peers.

The *tunnel network pool* must be a unique network not already existing on the server or any of the peers.
:end

:wg_local_tunnel_address_help:
This field is auto filled-in when a local tunnel network pool is created. It is allowed to overwrite the assignment, but this is normally not necessary. Use with care when changing manually.
:end

:end

:wg_local_endpoint_help:
This field is automatically filled in with the public management domain name *&lt;wan-ip&gt;.&lt;hash&gt;.myunraid.net* or the public address of the server.<br>
This allows VPN tunnels to be established from external peers to the server.<br>
Configure the correct port forwarding on your router (default port is <?=$netport['wg0']?> but this may be changed) to allow any incoming connections to reach the server.

Users with a registered domain name can use this field to specify how their server is known on the Internet. E.g. www.myserver.mydomain.<br>
Again make sure your router is properly set up.

Note to Cloudflare users: the Cloudflare proxy is designed for http traffic, it is not able to proxy VPN traffic. You must disable the Cloudflare proxy in order to use VPN with your domain.

:wg_local_server_uses_nat_help:
When NAT is enabled, the server uses its own LAN address when forwarding traffic from the tunnel to other devices in the LAN network.
Use this setting when no router modifications are desired, but this approach doesn't work with Docker containers using custom IP addresses.

When NAT is disabled, the server uses the WireGuard tunnel address when forwarding traffic.
In this case it is required that the default gateway (router) has a static route configured to refer tunnel address back to the server.
:end

:wg_local_gateway_uses_upnp_help:
Defaults to YES if the local gateway has UPnP enabled and is responding to requests.<br>
When UPnP is enabled, it is not necessary to configure port forwarding on the router to allow incoming tunnel connections. This is done automatically.
:end

:wg_local_tunnel_firewall_help:
The firewall function controls remote access over the WireGuard tunnel to specific hosts and/or subnets.<br>
The default rule is "deny" and blocks addresses specified in this field, while allowing all others.<br>
Changing the rule to "allow" inverts the selection, meaning only the specified addresses are allowed and all others are blocked.<br>
Use a comma as separator when more than one IP address is entered.
:end

:wg_mtu_size_help:
Leave this to the default automatic mode to select the MTU size. This MTU size is common for all peer connections.
:end

:wg_peer_configuration_help:
The <i class='fa fa-fw fa-eye'></i> icon is used to view a peer's configuration. A configuration can be downloaded or read directly for instant set up of the peer.<br>
The icon is disabled when no peer configuration exists or the user has made changes to the existing settings which are not applied yet.

The <i class='fa fa-fw fa-key'></i> icon is used to show or hide the private, public and preshared keys. Note that these fields are always shown when no keys are set.
:end

:wg_peer_name_help:
Use this field to set a name for this peer connection and make it easily recognizable. The same name will appear in the configuration of the peer at the opposite side.
:end

:wg_peer_preshared_key_help:
For added security a preshared key can be used. Use the **Generate Key** button to automatically create a unique preshared key.<br>
This key is the same at both server and peer side and is added to the peer configuration as well.
:end

:wg_peer_tunnel_address_help:
This field is auto filled-in when a local tunnel network pool is created. It is allowed to overwrite the assignment, but this is normally not necessary. Use with care when changing manually.<br>
Each peer must have a unique tunnel IP address.
:end

:wg_peer_endpoint_help:
When this field is left empty, the server operates in *passive mode* to establish the tunnel. It must be the peer which starts the tunnel.

When an IP address is entered to connect to the peer, the server operates in *active mode* and establishes the tunnel to the peer as soon as there is data to send.

*Note: this field is mandatory for "server-to-server" and "LAN-to-LAN" connections*
:end

:wg_peer_allowed_ips_help:
This field is automatically filled in with the tunnel address of the peer. This allows the server to reach the peer over the tunnel.<br>
When the peer is another server or router with additional networks, then their subnets can be added here to make these networks reachable over the tunnel.
:end

:wg_peer_dns_server_help:
Use this entry to overwrite the current DNS server assignment of the Peer
:end

:wg_persistent_keepalive_help:
By default a WireGuard tunnel stays silent when no traffic is present, which may cause the connection to drop.
Normally this isn't a problem since a WireGuard tunnel is automatically re-established when it is needed.<br>
A keepalive timer will hold the connection open, for most situations a timer value of 20 seconds is suitable.

Note that for mobile devices this will use more data and drain your battery faster.
:end

:sysdrivers_intro_help:
This page displays all the drivers available on this system. Filter the list according to whether the driver is Inuse or not, or search for a specific driver if desired.

Any 3rd party driver installed by a plugin will have a support symbol next to it, click this to get support for the plugin.

Click the edit button to add/modify/delete any modprobe.d config file in the config/modprobe.d directory on the flash drive.
:end

:console_keyboard_help:
Select your default keymap for the local console (not the web Terminal).
:end

:console_screen_help:
**Default:** 'Default' will set the blank timeout to 15 minutes and powersave to 60 minutes.

**Disabled:** 'Disabled' will disable the blank and powersave timeout.

**All other values:** Will set the blank timout to the selected value and disable the powersave timeout.
:end

:console_bash_help:
If set to 'Yes' the bash history will persist reboots, set to 'No' to disable.

**ATTENTION:** The bash history will be written to the USB Boot device so this will introduce higher wear and tear!

**Note:** Disabling and Enabling will remove the entire bash history.
:end

:WOL_intro_help:
This page allows the setup to start/resume and stop VMs, Containters(Docker and LXC) using WOL magic packets

It does not setup wake up of the Unraid server.

The process will look for the defined mac address defined within the service(VM or container) with the exception of dockers. Dockers do not have a mac address until they are running so you will need to define a user mac address to allow you to start them

If the service is paused a WOL Packet will resume. 

For each service you can set: enable, disable or enable and shutdown

When the enable and shutdown is set if the service is running when the next WOL packet is recieved a shutdown will be performed.
:end

:WOL_enable_help:
If set to yes Unraidwold daemon is set to run.
:end

:WOL_run_docker_help:
If set to yes when wake on lan packets are received checks are carrried out for dockers otherwise dockers will be ignored.
:end

:WOL_run_VM_help:
If set to yes when wake on lan packets are received checks are carrried out for virtual machines otherwise virtual machines will be ignored.
:end

:WOL_run_LXC_help:
If set to yes when wake on lan packets are received checks are carrried out for LXC otherwise LXC will be ignored. The LXC plugin needs to be installed for LXC to be processed.
:end

:WOL_run_shutdown_help:
If set to yes when wake on lan packets are received checks are carrried out and if enabled for service and that service is running the entity will be shutdown. System has to be set to Enabled and Shutdwon for it to be action.
:end

:WOL_interface_help:
Specify the interface to the daemon to bind to. Some interfaces may not be able to recieve etherframe packets. Recommend to bind to a physical interface.
:end

:WOL_promiscuous_mode_help:
Enable to set the NIC not to filer packets.
:end

:WOL_log_file_help:
Default is to log to syslog but if you want a different log location set the file name.
:end
