; page intro text
:parityProblems_intro_plug:
The **Parity Problems Assistant** is part of the **Parity Check Tuning** plugin.<p/>
The current status is **EXPERIMENTAL** and it is always possible that this assistant may be removed in the future).  
**(feedback is welcomed on the basic concept and ideas for improvement)**.<p/>
The idea is that this assistant can be used after a parity check or read check has reported problems and logged the details of any problem sectors to the syslog.  
In many cases such errors can be due to external factors such as cabling or the power supply rather than the actual disks.<p/>
It is also not uncommon, particularly on **Ryzen/ThreadRipper** based systems, to get random parity errors if the RAM is overclocked
(an XMP profile **is** an overclock),  
and the motherboard/CPU combination may also impose limits that are lower than the RAM is capable of supporting.<p/>
If you think you have rectified whatever caused the problems to occur then you can use this assistant to run a partial check over a narrow range to see if the problem still occurs.  
This can be much faster than having to run a full parity check or read check to see if you have resolved the issue or to run a disk extended SMART test to test the actual disk.<p/>
**IMPORTANT**:  This assistant should never be used as an alternative to running a full parity check once you think the problem has been resolved.

The Resume value must be greater than the Pause one for the heat related Pause and Resume to work correctly as they are both subtracted from the disk temperature warning value when calculating the desired temperature=

:parity_tune_explain_plug:
> The main purpose of this plugin is to allow you to limit array operations such as parity checks to running at times that will not inconvenience you.
>
>If you have set this to **No** then you get the default system behavior of parity checks running without a break to completion unless you manually stop/pause/cancel them.
>
>Setting this option to **Yes** specifies that parity checks should be run in increments spread over several days.
> As an example of what this plugin can do assume
>You have a parity check you have scheduled to start on the first of every month at midnight  
>* Your past experience has shown that if the parity check runs uninterrupted it takes 30 hours to complete.  
>* You set this plugin to use 3 hour increments starting at midnight and finishing at 3.00 A.M.  
>* The parity check will now actually take 10 days elapsed time (10 x 3 = 30) so the parity check will complete on 10th of the month.  
>* You have scheduled these increments to run starting at midnight and finishing at 3:00 A.M. when you know the system is not being used.  
>* You are not worried about this increased elapsed time and will welcome the increased system responsiveness during normal use.  
>* The rest of the month this plugin will do nothing as there is no active parity check in progress when the start time for an increment comes around.
>
>**CAUTION:**  If the array is stopped while an array operation is incomplete then the progress so far is lost and it can only be restarted from the beginning

:parity_tune_frequency_plug:

To support any user looking for other frequencies there is the option to set up <strong>Custom</strong> schedules which will allow for more complicated schedules for the Pause and Resume times.

> It is quite likely that you will want such a check to run to completion without interruption and if so leave this option set to **No**.
> With this option set to **Yes** then if you manually start a Parity Check from the Main page and then manually Pause the check, this will result in the check being run in increments between the scheduled times until the Parity Check completes.
:end

:parity_tune_automatic_plug:
> if the unRaid system is not shutdown cleanly then the next time the array is started unRaid will automatically start a non-correcting parity check (or a read check if you have no parity disk). This can happen for a wide variety of reasons ranging from power loss; hardware issues; and software issues.  The automatic check is run because if there are any parity errors this can compromise the ability to recover from an array drive failure at a later date so you want to get back to having valid parity as soon as is practical.
> 
> If this option is set then the check will be allowed to run for a few minutes (as any errors after an unclean shutdown are most likely to be at the start of the disks as they were not unmounted cleanly) and then automatically put the check into a paused state (if outside the time specified for running increments) and then the  remainder of the check subsequently run in increments according to the time slots specified for running increments.

:parity_tune_resume_plug:
> The time at which a paused parity check should be resumed.<br>If no parity check is currently paused when this time comes around then no action will be taken.

:parity_tune_pause_plug:
> The time at which a running parity check should be paused. Typically, this would be set to be a time when you want other activity to not be affected by a running parity check.
>If no parity check is actively running when this time comes around then no action will be.
>
>Normally you want to make sure that this time is set to be after the time that you schedule regular parity checks to run.  The first increment will then be from when the regular parity check is scheduled to start up to the time you have specified for the increment to end.
>
>If the increment period has been set to **Custom** then the hours/minutes fields are hidden and you are instead given the option to set the time in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron#Overview"  target="_blank">crontab</a> format.
>
>You also want to make sure that the time allocated to running increments is sufficient to expect the parity check to run to completion before the next check is scheduled to start.   Since most people only schedule parity checks to run infrequently (e.g. Monthly or Quarterly) then this is unlikely to be an issue but it is something to take into consideration.

> Do not select **Yes** unless you are absolutely certain that is what you want.

:parity_tune_clear_plug:
> Should disk Clear operations be run using increments.<br><br>A disk Clear operation occurs when you add a new drive (that has not been pre-cleared (using the Pre-Clear plugin) to an array that is parity protected.  The Clear process writes zeroes to every sector on the new disk so that it can be added to the array without affecting the existing parity. Until the Clear operation has completed you are not able to format the disk in unRaid and start using it for storing data.
>
>Since until the Clear operation completes the disk will not be available for use it is likely that most people will want this option left at **No**.   In addition, a Clear operation tends not to put much of a load on the system so is less likely to impact performance in normal daily use.
:end

:parity_tune_restart_plug:
> Unraid will normally abandon a parity check if the system is shutdown, rebooted  or the array is stopped (with the only option being to restart the parity check from the beginning).  
> Setting this option allows parity checks to be restarted by this plugin from the point they had reached as long as the following criteria are met:  
>* The array was shutdown tidily  
>* The user must not have made any changes to the array configuration.
>
>As long as these criteria are met then when the array is next started the operation is resumed from the point previously reached.
>
>**NOTES:**  
>* If the array operation was within the time set for a scheduled increment to be running then on restarting the array operation it will be set to be paused if now outside the time set for running increments.  
>* If the array operation was manually paused then the restarted array operation will also be paused  
>* If you want to use this feature by simply stopping the array without immediately using the **Reboot** or **Shutdown** buttons then you first need to manually **Pause** the array operation before using the **Stop** button.  If you to this and successfully stop the array then the array operation will now be resumed if you simply **Start** the array again, and also on the next array start after **Reboot** or **Shutdown**.

The idea is that you want to do a tidy shutdown before the disks become damaged due to overheating badly.   The shutdown that is triggered is functionally the same as would be the case of pressing the Shutdown button on the Main page of the unRaid GUI.

It will write even more verbose messages to the syslog but these are not likely to be interesting (or even meaningful) to the average user.  These messages will have the word **TESTING** added to the start of messages. You should only run this level of logging if you have been asked to as it can quickly fill up your syslog if you are not careful.

>If you have Testing mode set for the logging then you can choose where you want log messages to be recorded.  The default is the standard system syslog and this is the inly option allowed in Basic mode.  The syslog is held in RAM so does not cause excessive writes to the flash drive. 
>To facilitate with debugging problems then in Testing mode you can log the messages to the flash drive either instead of the syslog or in addition to the syslog. The resulting parityTuning.log file will be stored in the plugin's folder on the flash drive and providing this file to the developer will help with diagnosing any unexpected behaviour you encounter.
