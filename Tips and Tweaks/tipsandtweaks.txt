:tips_tweaks_general_plug:
> Some General Recommendations:
>
> + Use of a static IP address can help in certain cases.  NFS shares are referenced by IP address.  Be sure you reserve the IP address on your router, or set a very high IP address to prevent conflicts.
> + Use of Jumbo Frames is discouraged.  Jumbo Frames have been known to cause issues with some Dockers.
> + Don't set vm.dirty.ratio above 20% unless you have a UPS backup for your Unraid.  You may lose data that has not been written to disk on a power failure.
> + A value of vm.dirty_background_ratio over 1/2 of vm.dirty_ratio is not recommended unless using single digits for both values.

:tips_tweaks_nic_flow_control_plug:
> Set to 'Yes' to disable NIC Flow Control.  NIC Flow Control was originally implemented to help in
> networks with mixed speed devices.  It doesn't seem to be as necessary on today's networks.  If you
> have a managed switch, flow control can generally be turned on and off on the switch.  If you have
> a consumer grade switch, you won't have that level of control.  Flow Control has been known to create
> network issues in certain circumstances.  It is recommended to disable Flow Control if you experience network issues.
>
> Changing from any setting to 'Default' requires a reboot.

:tips_tweaks_nic_offload_plug:
> Set to 'Yes' to disable NIC offloads.  Offloads were developed to offload some network processing
> to the NIC and off the main CPU and deal with large packets.  This was intended to save some CPU processing
> load and increase network throughput.  TSO offload has been known to cause network issues in certain circumstances.
> It is recommended to disable NIC Offloads if you experience network issues.

> Changing from any setting to 'Default' requires a reboot.

> Caution: Don't increase these values beyond the default settings unless you have a UPS that will reliably shut down Unraid.
>
