>
> File open, read, write, and modify activity is monitored and logged on the array using inotify and is displayed by disk or share, UD disks, and cache.
> You need to start the File Activity in order to log the disk activity.
> File Activity is intended to be running for short periods so you can check disk activity.
> A server with a lot of file activity can fill the log space.
> The 'appdata' and 'Syslogs' directories are excluded.
>
> Note: File Activity monitoring is stopped if the array is stopped, and will restart when the array is started if it is enabled.
